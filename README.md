# Python-exercises
This repository contains exercises done during my introduction to python in my specialisation in bioinformatics.*

Each file has a series of exercises described and my proposed solution to them. Notice that other extra files are used to include specific data in the exercises, as for instance the molecular_weights.py, with a dictionary containing the molecular weight value of each aminoacid key, which can be imported as a module for some exercises.
Other files (e.g. ".fasta") can be used as input for the exercises. 
All These extra files need to be located in the same directory as the exercise script.


*Note that they don't necessarily contain the unique or optimal solution for the described problems. They are adjusted to the progress of the course.
